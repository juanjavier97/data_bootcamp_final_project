Project Description:

The project found within this repository examines the relationship between the U.S. Yield Curve and economic crises in the United States. It has long been established that when yields on short-term Treasuries are higher than yields on long-term Treasuries (i.e. the Yield Curve inverts), an economic decline follows shortly thereafter. This project takes a deeper look at this by analyzing four economic indicators (i.e. Unemployment Rate, Vehicle Sales, Indutrial Production Index, and the Effective Federal Funds Rate) after the Yield Curve has inverted in 1982, 1989, 1998, 2000-2001, and 2006-2007. The analysis will include statistics on the data, a plot for each economic indicator, and a normalized plot for each inversion. All of the data used comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED).
